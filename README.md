# VR Acid Cam Experiment on Oculus Devkit 2

This repository houses an experimental VR application tailored for the Oculus Devkit 2, a project inspired by my desire to create a version of Acid Cam for virtual reality. Initially, this development journey began with enthusiasm, especially during the period when Oculus supported macOS. However, following the shift in Oculus's support away from macOS in favor of other platforms, I made the decision to discontinue the project rather than transitioning to Windows.


Though the technology and the project may seem a bit dated with the advent of retail versions of VR hardware, I believe it's valuable to share this work. It stands as a testament to a fascinating learning experience and a pivotal moment in my exploration of VR development. The code within this repository reflects the experimental nature of the application and the creative exploration involved in adapting Acid Cam to a VR environment during the time macOS support was available.


This project was not just about the end product but also about the journey and the challenges encountered along the way. It was a fun and insightful adventure into VR development, offering a unique perspective on adapting existing concepts to new and emerging technologies.
